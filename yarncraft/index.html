<h1>My Yarncraft</h1>

I have craft things in a few places on the web.  Where to find it all:

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Almost everything I've made out of yarn since around the beginning of
the ravelry beta and some things from before that can be found on my <a
href="http://ravelry.com/projects/cayenne">ravelry project page</a>.
You need a ravelry account to view that page, but if you're at all
interested in knitting or crocheting you probably already have one (or
really should get one.)</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<p>Information about patterns for things I've designed can be found <a
href="patterns/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Combination Knitting</h2>

I am a combination knitter and have written some things possibly useful
for beginning combination knitters <a href="combination.html">here</a>

<h2>For Sale</h2>

<p>I used to sell things on Etsy.  I don't keep <a
href="http://cayenne.etsy.com">my shop</a> stocked currently, but it's
always possible that I'll start putting stuff up again and would
probably be open to special orders.</p> </div>
