I have craft things in a few places on the web.  Where to find it all:

## Projects

Almost everything I've made out of yarn since around the beginning of
the ravelry beta and some things from before that can be found on my
[ravelry project page](http://ravelry.com/projects/cayenne)
You need a ravelry account to view that page, but if you're at all
interested in knitting or crocheting you probably already have one (or
really should get one.)

<div data-filter='{"happiness":[4]}'>If you have JavaScript
enabled, some of my favorite projects that I've done will appear here in
a moment.</div>

More examples:
[amigurumi](showcase.html?permalink=yellow-pigs+amigurumi-octopus+amigurumi-jellyfish)

## Patterns

Information about patterns for things I've designed can be found
[here](patterns/index.html)

## Combination Knitting

I am a combination knitter and have written some things possibly useful
for beginning combination knitters [here](combination.html)

## For Sale

I used to sell things on Etsy.  I don't keep
[my shop](http://cayenne.etsy.com) stocked currently, but it's
always possible that I'll start putting stuff up again and would
probably be open to special orders.
