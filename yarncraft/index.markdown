I have craft things in a few places on the web.  Where to find it all:

## Projects

Almost everything I've made out of yarn since around the beginning of
the ravelry beta and some things from before that can be found on my
[ravelry project page](http://ravelry.com/projects/cayenne)
You need a ravelry account to view that page, but if you're at all
interested in knitting or crocheting you probably already have one (or
really should get one.)  Or you can access some of them from here:

<div data-filter='{"happiness":[4]}'>If you have JavaScript
enabled, some of my favorite projects that I've done will appear here in
a moment.</div>

## Patterns

Information about patterns for things I've designed can be found
[here](patterns/index.html)

## Combination Knitting

I am a combination knitter and have written some things possibly useful
for beginning combination knitters [here](combination.html)

## For Sale

I used to sell things on Etsy.  I don't keep
[my shop](http://cayenne.etsy.com) stocked currently, but it's
always possible that I'll start putting stuff up again and would
probably be open to special orders.
